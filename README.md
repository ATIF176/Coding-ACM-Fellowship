#Welcome to the ACM Fellowship Coding Practice repository!
This repository is meant to serve as a collection of your practice code for LeetCode problems and basic Python projects completed during your participation in the ACM Fellowship Program in the coding niche. The main goal of this repository is to track your progress, showcase your coding skills, and collaborate with other participants.

## Description

The ACM Fellowship Coding Practice repository is an initiative to help you grow as a coder and improve your problem-solving skills. In this repository, you can find your solutions to various LeetCode problems, as well as small Python projects you have worked on during the ACM Fellowship Program.

Feel free to organize the repository in a way that makes sense to you. You can create folders for different categories of problems, such as arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, etc. Additionally, create a separate folder for your Python projects. Make sure to include a brief description of each project in its respective folder.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you should have Git installed on your computer. If you don't have it already, you can download it from the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Follow these steps to clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/acm-fellowship-coding.git
cd acm-fellowship-coding
```

## LeetCode Problems

In the "LeetCode" folder, you can add your solutions to various LeetCode problems you have solved during the ACM Fellowship Program. Create subfolders for different problem categories and add your code files there. You can also include a README.md file in each subfolder, explaining the problem and your approach to solving it.

Example structure:

```
- LeetCode
  - Arrays
    - TwoSum.py
    - MaximumSubarray.py
    - ...
  - Strings
    - ValidPalindrome.py
    - LongestSubstring.py
    - ...
  - Trees
    - BinaryTreePaths.py
    - ValidateBinarySearchTree.py
    - ...
  - ...
```

## Python Projects

In the "Projects" folder, you can add small Python projects you have worked on during the ACM Fellowship Program. Each project should have its own folder, containing the project files and a README.md file describing the project's purpose, features, and how to run it.

Example structure:

```
- Projects
  - WebScraper
    - main.py
    - scraper.py
    - README.md
  - CalculatorApp
    - main.py
    - calculator.py
    - README.md
  - ...
```

## Contributing
